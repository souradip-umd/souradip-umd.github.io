I'm Souradip, a 3rd year CS Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), working on the Foundations of Trust-worthy Reinforcement Learning, with a focus on developing safe, reliable, deployable & provable RL methods for real-world applications such as robotics, healthcare, finance, etc, working with [Prof. Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/), [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) (UMD) and in close collaboration with [Prof. Mengdi Wang](https://mwang.princeton.edu/) (Princeton), [Prof. Amrit Singh Bedi](https://sites.google.com/view/amritsinghbedi/home) (UCF), [Alec Koppel](https://koppel.netlify.app/) (AI Research Head, JP Morgan Chase & Co).

My latest research focuses on designing a reliable and unified framework for RLHF by characterizing the dependence of policy-driven data on alignment objectives [**PARL**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02585). I am particularly interested in the statistical understanding of *learning from preferences* by examining the biases inherent in preference data and its long-term ethical considerations, and societal impacts.
